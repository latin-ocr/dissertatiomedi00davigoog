“ The preparation (inquit Dodlor Baillie) of the
⁶⁶ Barbadoes leg in my polleffion, is a fection of the
y “ leit leg2 a little under the eall: It mensures about
‘.‘ four inches in diameter from one fide to the o·
“ ther, and nearly five inches from the fore to the
“ back part. The lkin upon its outet lutiace is
“ rough‚ being raised into a great many tubercled,
“ or excrescences‚ which are most of them ofa

, “ small hze, but some are as large as halla garden

⁴ ‘⁶ pea. The lkin is twice as thick as common heal-
⁶‘ thy lldn, and the cuticle covering it is thicker,
“ and less transnatent than common cuticle.
